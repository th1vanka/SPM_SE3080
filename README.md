## Project Description:

Easy-Buy is an online store which is dedicated to serve customers by making purchasing goods as simple as one click away and helps sellers to advertise their goods and makes selling easier. This store mainly targets foreign customers. The seller is a registered user who can add, search, remove or update items to the system and add his details to the system, search his details and update his details. The seller must first get permission from the system admin before posting items, the seller sends a request to add the item to the list and the admin may accept the request. The customer can add ratings, delete ratings, and see the posts that are uploaded by the seller. The customer may add items to the cart before proceeding with the payment, update the items added to the cart and remove items from the cart. The customer can manage their profile and edit their information. After making the payment the customer can track the order, the web page will display whether the order is processing, confirmed or delivered. This system consists of four main functions which are item management, customer management, seller management and order & rating management.
